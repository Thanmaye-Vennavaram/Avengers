  <h2 style="text-align: left;"> Captain Marvel </h2>
  <p style="text-align: left; font-size: 20px; "> 
Former Air Force pilot and intelligence agent Carol Danvers pursued her dream of space exploration as a NASA employee, but her life forever changed when she was accidentally transformed into a <img src="https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/12/124259/7825231-rco001_1614187000.jpg" width="200px" style="float: right; margin: 20px;">  human-Kree hybrid with extraordinary powers.<br> <br>
Now, Carol is the latest warrior to embrace the mantle of Captain Marvel, and she has taken her place as one of the world’s mightiest heroes. </p>
    
      <br> 

    <h5 style="text-align: left;"> Higher, Further, Faster, More </h5>

   <p style="text-align: left; font-size: 20px;">  As a NASA security officer, Carol investigated numerous attempts made by the Kree and Skrulls to infiltrate Kennedy Space Center and disrupt America’s space program. During a battle between the heroic Mar-Vell and his rival, Yon-Rogg, Carol was exposed to the Psyche-Magnitron, a Kree device that could make imagination into reality. Carol subconsciously envied Mar-Vell’s powers, and the machine responded to those desires by rewriting her DNA to make her a human/Kree hybrid with abilities similar to his. <br> <br>
Carol took on the identity of Ms. Marvel and even fought alongside Mar-Vell/Captain Marvel and the Avengers. Her early career was cut short when Rogue, a member of the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, attacked Carol and permanently drained her powers and memories. It took years for Carol to recover from her ordeal, but she finally achieved her dream of space exploration and traveled far from Earth. Carol even became cosmically empowered and took on the codename Binary. <br> <br>
The Binary powers faded over time, leaving Carol with most of her original abilities. Carol returned to Earth and rejoined the Avengers. Years later, Carol adopted the codename Captain Marvel as a tribute to her fallen friend and mentor. Her prominence has also grown exponentially, and Captain Marvel is now the most popular heroine in the world. </p>
      <img src="https://terrigen-cdn-dev.marvel.com/content/prod/1x/008cmv_com_inl_01.jpg" width="500px" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;">

  <h5 style="text-align: left;"> Bird of War</h5>
  <p style="text-align: left; font-size: 20px;"> Carol Danvers was already in excellent shape before she was transformed by the Psyche-Magnitron. Afterwards, Carol’s body was pushed to the peak of human fitness and modified with Kree DNA. Her powers include enhanced strength, stamina, agility, and durability, as well as flight, and almost total immunity to toxins and poisons. Carol also has a “seventh sense” which gives her precognitive flashes of the future, but the power randomly manifests and has largely faded away. <br> <br>
As Binary, Carol’s connection to the power of a white hole allows her to generate and control any form of radiation or gravity, as well as the ability to survive and travel in space without the protection of a spacesuit. Although the vast majority of Carol’s Binary powers have been lost, she still retains the ability to absorb energy and fire photonic blasts from her hands. If Carol is exposed to enough energy, her full Binary powers have the potential to temporarily reemerge. </p>

  <h5> Carol's Corner </h5>
    <p> During her espionage days, Carol befriends Wolverine, Nick Fury, and Ben Grimm (the Thing). She eventually aligns herself with the Agent (Rick Mason), although they are initially on opposite sides. Since adopting her original Ms. Marvel identity, Carol has become close friends with Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew), Jessica Jones, and Wonder Man, as well as other members of the Avengers. Carol is also an inspiration for the current Ms. Marvel, Kamala Khan.<br> <br>
When Carol is in charge of Operation: Lightning Storm, she takes Spider-Girl/Araña (Anya Corazon) under her wing and accepts Machine Man as her teammate. Carol also joins the Starjammers, Guardians of the Galaxy, the Ultimates, and A-Force, while forging close connections with them as well. At one point, Carol also has a romantic relationship with War Machine (James Rhodes), but their time is cut short by his tragic demise.<br> <br>
More recently, Carol serves as commander of the Alpha Flight space station with Abigail Brand and three original Alpha Flight members: Aurora, Puck, and Sasquatch. Additionally, Carol adopts a cat named Chewie, which is actually a Flerken, an alien species that resembles felines from Earth. A young Kree girl nicknamed Bean has also earned her place in Carol’s heart. Carol feels very protective towards Bean, and she even traveled to an alternate universe to bring her home safely. </p>

    <h5> Destined for Greatness </h5>
  <p style="font-size: 20px;"> When she was a young girl, Carol Danvers dreamed of becoming an astronaut and exploring the cosmos. However, Carol’s aspirations for higher education were thwarted by her father, who chose to send her younger brother, Steve, to college instead of her. Despite the setback, Carol graduated from high school at the top of her class and enlisted in the United States Air Force when she turned eighteen. Once again, Carol excelled and quickly rose through the ranks as one of the Air Force’s top pilots. </p> 
    <img src="https://terrigen-cdn-dev.marvel.com/content/prod/1x/008cmv_com_inl_03.jpg" width="400px" style="float: left;"> 
    <p style="font-size: 20px;"> During a reconnaissance mission over Afghanistan, Carol’s plane was shot down by insurgents led by Ghazi Rashid. Carol suffered a broken leg in the crash, and she was subsequently captured and tortured by Rashid and his men. Amazingly, Carol not only managed to escape, but she killed most of her captors as well. Air Force Special Operations officer Michael Rossi debriefed Carol, and was so impressed by her that he recruited her into Special Operations and began training her as a spy.
As Carol embarked on her new path, Michael became her mentor and her lover. She also crossed paths with Nick Fury, as well as Ben Grimm and Logan (James Howlett). Eventually, Carol left the spy world behind to pursue her original passion at NASA. She became the head of security at the Kennedy Space Center, where she met Dr. Walter Lawson, a man who was secretly the Kree spy known as Mar-Vell.<br> <br>
Mar-Vell became very close to Carol, and he developed a kinship for humanity while acting to protect the Earth. He was soon called Captain Marvel by the public and recognized as a hero. As both the Kree and the Skrulls attempted to infiltrate NASA, Carol investigated Mar-Vell’s human identity before she was captured by his Kree rival, Yon-Rogg. In the subsequent battle between Mar-Vell and Yon-Rogg, Carol was knocked into a Kree device called the Psyche-Magnitron. Somehow, the machine dramatically altered Carol’s DNA by making her half-Kree and giving her powers similar to Mar-Vell’s superhuman abilities.<br> <br>
Carol’s career at NASA was devastated by the ongoing incursions and attacks. After being demoted well below her original position, Carol angrily resigned and wrote a tell-all book about her experiences. It quickly became a best-seller and opened the door for her new writing career. However, Carol’s life was complicated by the Psyche-Magnitron’s changes to her mind and body. She developed a split personality who went into action as Ms. Marvel, with a costume that resembled Mar-Vell’s outfit. Carol had no memory of her activities as Ms. Marvel, and she was alarmed by her blackouts and her missing time.<br> <br>
Over the next few months, Carol became aware of her alter-ego, but her two personalities remained distinct and separate. That changed in the aftermath of a Kree attack, with a mind-altering device which backfired and unified Carol’s two personas. Now truly a new woman, Carol embraced her role as Ms. Marvel and rapidly became a prominent heroine. Carol was even invited to join the Avengers, which she readily accepted.</p>

    <p style="font-size: 20px;"> So, Marvel likes to have us sit through the end credits of their movies to receive the cinematic crumbs that hint at the future direction of our Avengers heroes. These hints then encourage the Internet to smolder endlessly with speculation until the next film. Not a bad marketing device.
<br> <br> 
The crumb at the end of Infinity War has Nick Fury sending a signal with a clunky pager-like device as chaos from “the Snap” envelops New York City. Just in time, too... because, poof. Nick is gone. Maria Hill is already dust. But the Captain Marvel symbol glows on the device’s tiny screen, inviting our hero to be a key player in the follow-up movie. And so here we are, on the eve of Endgame, talking about Carol Danvers. <br><br>
      <img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/neris/public/images/articles/captain-marvel-personality.svg" width="700px">
    <br> <br>
      Since Captain Marvel is still in theaters as of this writing, we’ll avoid spoilers – mostly. At least, we won’t reveal any more than the trailers do. That will be easy, though, since we’re discussing Carol Danvers’s personality type. The film reveals much about her basic ways of thinking and acting long before many of the plot twists occur.
      <br> <br>
      We believe that Captain Marvel has an Assertive Entertainer (ESFP-A) personality type. We often talk about Explorers as individuals who are so flexible that they “think on their feet” when finding solutions. They are people of action, and that can truly be said of Carol Danvers.
      <br> <br>
      Danvers is an outgoing team player. Her interaction with the Kree team and flashbacks to desert bars and flyboy – that is, flygirl – camaraderie on Earth demonstrate her Extraverted personality from the beginning.
       <br> <br>
      Throughout the film, we get only a gregarious vibe from her. While capable of working on her own when necessary – and it’s often necessary (see the Prospecting section below) – she appears to need people and to gather energy from them. When she can’t sleep, she finds her trainer for a workout session rather than hanging out alone.

      <li> 1960s - Marvel Super-Heroes #13<br> <br> <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d1/Marvel_sup_heroes_01.jpg" width="200px"> <br> <br> The character debuted in Marvel Super-Heroes #13 (March 1968) by writer Roy Thomas and artist Gene Colan. In the story, she is an officer in the United States Air Force and Security Chief of a restricted military base, where Danvers meets Dr. Walter Lawson, the human alias of alien Kree hero Captain Marvel. In a later story, Danvers is caught in the explosion of a Kree device after trying to get close to Captain Marvel. Although Captain Marvel manages to save her life, Danvers sustains serious injuries </li> <br> <br>
      <li> 1970s - Ms. Marvel <br>  <img src="https://www.writeups.org/wp-content/uploads/Ms-Marvel-Carol-Danvers-Marvel-Comics-3-j.jpg" width="200px"> <br> <br> Danvers resurfaces with superhuman abilities and becomes the hero Ms. Marvel (created by writer Gerry Conway and artist John Buscema) in a self-titled series in January 1977, at first written by Gerry Conway and later by Chris Claremont. In the series, she is the editor of Women Magazine, a spin-off of the Daily Bugle. It is revealed that the energy exposure from the explosion of a device called the "Psyche-Magnetron" caused Danvers's genetic structure to meld with Captain Marvel's, effectively turning her into a human-Kree hybrid. Ms. Marvel had a series of semi-regular appearances in The Avengers, with additional appearances with the Defenders, Spider-Man, the Thing, and Iron Man. In one of these stories, the mutant terrorist Mystique kills Michael Barnett, Ms. Marvel's lover. </li> <br> <br>
      <li> 1980s - The Avengers #200 <br> <br> <img src="https://assets.mycast.io/actor_images/actor-the-avengers-200-458857_large.jpg?1655458089" width="200px"> <br> <br> In The Avengers #200 (Oct. 1980), which was written by Bob Layton, David Michelinie, George Pérez, and Jim Shooter, Ms. Marvel is kidnapped by a character named Marcus (the apparent son of Avengers foe Immortus) and taken to an alternate dimension, where she is raped by Marcus and impregnated. She gives birth on Earth to a child that rapidly ages into another version of Marcus, who is ultimately unable to remain on Earth after Hawkeye mistakenly damages his machine and takes Ms. Marvel back to the alternate dimension with no opposition from the Avengers, who perceive Ms. Marvel and Marcus to have fallen in love. Comic book historian Carol A. Strickland criticized the storyline in an essay, "The Rape of Ms. Marvel", due to the storyline implying Marcus to have potentially brainwashed Danvers into falling in love with him. Citing Marcus' line, "Finally, after relative weeks of such efforts—and admittedly, with a subtle boost from Immortus' machines—you became mine", Strickland posited that this constituted rape. As a former writer of the solo title, Chris Claremont also commented on the inappropriateness of the storyline, having been disallowed from having the character have a normal child and be a single mother.

<br>
      <li> 1990s - Operation Galactic Storm <br> <br>
      <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/64/Avengers-345.jpg" width="200px">
        <br> <br>Carol Danvers continued to make sporadic appearances, and two additional issues planned for the original title—prevented by cancellation—were printed in a quarterly anthology series. That same year she appeared extensively in the storyline "Operation Galactic Storm". Near the conclusion of the story, Danvers loses her connection to the white hole she drew her powers from while diverting anti-matter from the Earth's sun left by the passing Nega Bomb, reverting to her original Ms. Marvel powers. She retained the energy manipulation and absorption powers she had as Binary, but on a smaller scale.
      </li> <br> <br>

      <li> 2000s - Kang Dynasty or Kang War <br><br> <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/08/Avengers_v3_49.jpg" width="200px"> <br> <br> As Warbird, the character returns to the Avengers and plays a key role in the "Kang Dynasty" plotline. Kang's son Marcus, the Scarlet Centurion, falls in love with her, but she rejects him, in part because he reminds her of Marcus, son of Kang's older alter ego Immortus, who raped her. The Scarlet Centurion nonetheless helps her to defeat the Master of the World, a supervillain whose alien technology becomes the key to defeating Kang. In the course of the fight, Warbird kills the Master, and after the final victory over Kang she demands a court martial to review her actions. The court martial finds her killing justified as an act of war, and Carol continues as an Avenger. After the Avengers disband, Warbird leaves the group, and, along with other prominent former Avengers like Wasp, Hank Pym, Falcon and Wonder Man, is not included in the New Avengers group soon formed by Iron Man and Captain America.

      <li> 2010s - Siege of Asgard <br>  <br><img src="https://i.annihil.us/u/prod/marvel/i/mg/6/70/51df0435e64f5/portrait_uncanny.jpg" width="200px"> <br> In the conclusion of the second volume of Ms. Marvel, Carol Danvers battles her old nemesis Mystique and a clone of Captain Marvel created by the Skrulls during the Secret Invasion, after they carry out a series of tragedies at temples belonging to the Church of Hala, a church dedicated to Mar-Vell. Danvers later aids the allied forces of Steve Rogers against Iron Patriot during the Siege of Asgard. Danvers also begins to develop a friendship with Spider-Man. Though he infuriates her the first time they work together, the two become closer when he helps her during the "Dark Reign" storyline, and she later admits to having feelings for him. Following the conclusion of the "Siege" storyline, Ms. Marvel returns as a regular character in the second volume of The New Avengers.</li> <br><br>

During an investigation, Danvers discovers that she has a half-sister, Lauri-ell, who was genetically engineered using her mother's DNA. </li> <br>
